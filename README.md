- Implement real-time session management and matchmaking
- Demonstrate cloud DevOps best practices
- Show proficiency in AWS and cloud technologies
- Create a portfolio-worthy project

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- **Languages**: Python (FastAPI), JavaScript (WebSocket)
- **Cloud Provider**: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Container Orchestration**: Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- **Compute**: Amazon EC2 for EKS nodes
- **Databases**: Amazon DocumentDB (MongoDB compatible), Amazon ElastiCache for Redis
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with AWS CodeBuild/CodeDeploy
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub
